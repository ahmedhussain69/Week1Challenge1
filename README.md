## Project Description:

As part of my learning journey to become a front end developer, i was set a task to refactor code from some starter files:

Goals of this project as below:

1. Meet Accesibilty standards for HTML
2. Logical structure of HTML regardsless of styling and positioning
3. Semantic HTML to be used where possible
4. Heading attributes fall in a sequential order
5. Title elements contain conise, descriptive title(s)
6. Ensure the website is functioning as per design e.g links working, images present etc
7. Consildate CSS/HTML code where possible
8. Notation of code, so someone else can understand it


## Issues Encountered:

1. Upon adding elements to meet accessibility standards  and semantic HTML, the knock on 
   effects caused to styling.
2. Positioning and display issues

## Lessons Learned:

Breakdown each section into manageable chunks and test at every change so you can see the impact of your change immediatley if you have an issue you will know what has caused it.

## Installation:

None. You can use developer tools for your browser to inspect the HTML and CSS code

## Usage:

View using a browser and use developer tools to inspect
